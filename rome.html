            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>For my 1st destination, I will be visiting the Roman Colleseum for all the history and the stories from centuries ago. The colleseum was where the Gladiators would fight. I will travel to the imperial box where the emperor would sit. After I'm done I'm taking a flight over to barcelona.</p>
